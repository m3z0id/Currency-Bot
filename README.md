#### 🤖 Automated Backend Management

- **Mod Logging**: All staff actions executed via `/moderate` are automatically logged to the configured `mod_log_channel_id`, including the moderator, target, and reason.
- **Join/Leave Logging**: A clean, embed-based log of members joining, rejoining, or leaving is sent to the `join_leave_log_channel_id`.
- **Activity Tracking**: The bot passively monitors `on_message` and `on_interaction` events to keep a `last_active_timestamp` for all users, powering the inactivity pruner.
- **Smart Bump Reminders**: The bot listens for Disboard bumps, waits 2 hours, and then pings the `bumper_role_id`. If another 10 minutes pass, it pings the `backup_bumper_role_id`.
- **Server Stats Channels**: Automatically updates the names of designated voice channels to display live server statistics (e.g., "All members: 123", "Tag Users: 45").
- **Invite Tracking**: On `on_member_join`, the bot compares current invite uses against a cache to determine which invite was used and credits the correct inviter in the database.
- **Role Pruning**:
  - **Inactivity Pruner**: (Runs hourly) Checks all members against the `inactivity_days` setting. If a member is inactive, it removes any roles specified in the `roles_to_prune` config list.
  - **Custom Role Pruner**: (Runs hourly) Automatically deletes any roles with a name starting with `Custom: ` (configurable) that are older than 30 days.
